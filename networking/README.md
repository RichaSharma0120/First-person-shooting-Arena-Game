# Networking Documentation for Multiplayer FPS Arena

This directory contains the networking components of the Multiplayer FPS Arena game, which facilitate real-time communication between clients and the server using WebSockets.

## Overview

The networking module is responsible for managing the connections between players and the game server. It includes both the server and client implementations that handle message passing, player matchmaking, and game state synchronization.

## Components

- **WebSocket Server (`websocket_server.py`)**: This script sets up the WebSocket server that listens for incoming connections from clients. It manages player connections, broadcasts messages, and handles game state updates.

- **WebSocket Client (`websocket_client.py`)**: This script implements the client-side logic for connecting to the WebSocket server. It sends player actions and receives updates from the server regarding game state and other players.

## Requirements

To run the networking components, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- websockets

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the WebSocket server by running `websocket_server.py`.
2. Connect clients to the server using `websocket_client.py`.
3. Follow the instructions in the client script to send and receive messages.

## Future Improvements

- Implement authentication for players.
- Enhance error handling and reconnection logic.
- Optimize message formats for better performance.

This documentation will be updated as the networking features evolve.
