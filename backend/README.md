# Backend Documentation for Multiplayer FPS Arena

## Overview
The backend of the Multiplayer FPS Arena game is responsible for managing the game state, matchmaking players, and facilitating real-time communication between clients using WebSockets. This document provides an overview of the backend structure and its components.

## Directory Structure
- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the backend.
  - `server.py`: The main entry point for the backend server. It sets up the WebSocket server and handles incoming connections.
  - `matchmaking.py`: Manages the matchmaking system to pair players for games.
  - `game_state.py`: Manages the current state of the game, including player positions and scores.
  - `synchronization.py`: Handles synchronization of game state between clients and the server.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies for the backend, run the following command in the backend directory:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Server
To start the backend server, execute the following command:

```
python src/server.py
```

## Features
- **Matchmaking**: Automatically pairs players for competitive matches.
- **Game State Management**: Keeps track of player positions, scores, and health.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Utilizes WebSockets for low-latency interactions between players and the server.

## Future Improvements
- Implement additional game modes and rules.
- Enhance matchmaking algorithms for better player pairing.
- Optimize game state synchronization for improved performance.
